The ram plus doesn't make much difference but 4gb is good enough for me and very light gaming. The battery is really good for me who usually browses instagram and within an hour of use approx 10% of battery is used up which is fine for me. The camera quality isn't that good so don't buy if you are a photographer. there's no charging brick so i use an old samsung 5v 1.5A charger and takes like an hour to charge from 50-80%. You might need an adaptor to change from usb c to normal usb to use the cable inside There's both fingerprint and face unlock. The sim card holder can hold two sim cards or one sim card and one sd card. I will update this post when I've used it for a year. If you're someone who's not familiar with buying phones online and exchanging read carefully: For exchange, you need the phone you want to exchange its IMEI and go for exchange but make sure you don't add to cart but click buy so that you can check if the exchange is available. If it takes you to the payment section, exchange is available in your area. Make sure you factory reset the phone first and then fill up the space in your phone with movies or videos till 100% storage and then reset your phone again. You'll have to login with a Gmail account that's not important with no personal information and then download rabbit exchange on playstore and log out of gmail. Make sure you have wifi or hotspot during exchange For buying the phone, make sure you watch unboxing videos and check the imei after buying from Amazon . i suggest you take screenshots of the videos and compare the screenshots and imei from Amazon. Make sure you check where the seals are Do check how a phone should look when turning on for the first time. It should have a welcome or hello screen or something similar. When delivery driver comes, check all of these points and turn on the phone but don't put sim card in yet until you are happy with the phone. Check camera, speaker or what is important to you. You can ask chatgpt for help too. If you aren't free at home, ask a friend or someone trusted to check the phone for you and record the delivery if possible and if some defects happen, reject the delivery. Sometimes sellers give you second hand even though you asked for a new product, so do check during delivery. Most delivery persons are patient in my experience as long as you're not annoying and waste their time. Make sure you create a list of what to check to not waste time It's also a good idea to buy a phone cover and tempered glass More Hide Thank you for your feedback Close Sorry, there was an error Close Sorry we couldn't load the review Try again Top reviews from India There was a problem filtering reviews.

Reviewed in India on 4 July 2025 Size: 4GB RAM, 128 GB Storage Colour: Blazing Black Verified Purchase Got it under 8k, Value for money product, Fast Charging and Looks good. 4/128 is a great combination. 64 gb varient may have lags but 128 gb is fast enough for day to day tasks and great performance. Battery life is good. Camera average. No heats issue on normal usage. Display can be better but this price, it's awesome 😎. Type C 2 type C cable is useless for me as I have a Type A to Type C charger so no need to buy a new charger. Not sure about future updates of OS as Android 16 requirement is minimum 6GB ram but this one has only 4GB ram. But samsung promise for security updates. And it's durable as it's Samsung, not a chinese thing.

Pros Phone is fast for basic apps and has a nice speedy interface. Has a 3.5 mm jack hole for earphones. Nice sleek look and premium looking finish. Medium camera quality. Cons Was upset at receiving a Type C to C charging cable. This was bad because I couldn't use my old charger for it. Luckily I had my old USB cable which I used for charging. No dedicated SD card slot. 2 sim slot only. You need to remove 1 sim to fit the SD card. This was not mentioned in any of the reviews. Played music on the phone and found that output was less even at max volume. Same with phone calls. I'm giving a review after installing and using the phone for close to 8 hours in the day of receipt of the phone. Samsung needs to work on the above issues and stop cutting corners on giving useless Type C to C charging cables and provide universal USB chargers with cable. Have been using for 15 days. The phone is working fine. No heating or sound issues. Charging is a bit slow otherwise the interface is fast. No issues.

It runs on Samsung’s smooth One UI and offers a rare promise of 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security patches. Storage is ample, but the 4GB RAM sometimes struggles with multitasking, causing occasional lag. While it’s not built high-end performance, it’s a reliable choice for long-term software support at a low price. Hardware may limit future updates, but overall, it’s a solid entry-level pick.

Phone looks sleek in Blazing Black like apple phone and display quality is impressive. It supports 12 5G bands making it future proof and 25W fast charging is a big plus (just keep in mind it comes without charger). Highly recommended for both first time users and seniors who enjoy browsing and watching videos.

Reviewed in India on 9 July 2025 Size: 4GB RAM, 128 GB Storage Colour: Blazing Black Verified Purchase The best in this budget. I bought 4Gb -128gb variant for Rs.7499/- I had to buy this in emergency just for calls & WhatsApp but within 2 days this mobile turned into my primary device. Im using my everyday apps 25+ in this and taking  random calls and WhatsApp. I stream youtube for 2 hours a day along with other usage. I don't use camera much because I have an iphone. After 10days of extreme usage Im writing this review. Pros- Samsung UI - ultra optimised Performance - Top notochord Ram management - excellent 5g connectivity - excellent Audio quality - awesome Display - next level Battery - Extremely good Charging - 45-50 mins Cons- Nothing at all considering this price range. Camera - Decent Tips- 1) Do not install any Gaming apps. Apart from this this mobile is a game changer. 2) Set charger limit to 80% for healthy battery life. Charger when it's under 20%. It's bateery going to last for a whole day. 3) Back panel is very cheap quality. To reduce the price company did this. Use a solid back cover and a screen protector. Enjoy.
